# lsx-blog-customizer
This extension gives you control over the appearance of the blog on your LSX-powered WordPress site.

LSX is a theme we’ve built to be versatile, so it’s only fair we put the power in the users’ hands to make it look and work exactly how they want. The importance of an active blog with a large readership is an invaluable asset, so to encourage that on your site, use the blog customizer to select just the right layout, colour, metadata and more.
